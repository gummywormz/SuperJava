Abstract: The dances of indigenous computer represent several clear goals. One is to protest the sturctured and captialistic nature of their society. As they flow through their stacks, their internal structure makes a mockery of the strict society they are raised in. Since stacks can be considered to flow, they have similarities with the menstrual cycle in women. The stacks therefore reject toxic masculine ideas, and fight against the male driven patriarchy. Stacks also protest political candidate Hillary Clinton by working in the Assembly language. MOV commands can be seen as a movement away from established normalities. EAX, EBX and similar commands represent the internal struggle and issues the stack faces as it is forced to participate in political issues such as accessing a file system. This obvious dichotomy between the goals of the stack demonstrate an internalized patriarchy
