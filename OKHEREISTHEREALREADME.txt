hi, i was just like wondering. ok so i saw this cool post on my TUMBLR ^-^ about how everything is a social construct. so i was like wondering, are apps socially constructed? what if they, like want to be a cute little puppy or a happy little plant ^_^;. i tried to pet my snapchat but it didnt like it ;_;. anyway so i was just wondering if apps can have program reassignment surgery. what if they identify as a blackberry app? we need to make some cool progress in this world. it is 2016 and there is no excuse, i want to pet all of my facebooks!! ^_^ ^_^ ^_^ ^_^
