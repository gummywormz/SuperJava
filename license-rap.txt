Copyright (c) CURRENT YEAR G

Never has ev-ery member in one team been so diverse
Tryin to outdo the last meme that I birthed, that is my curse
Your knight in coding armor sentimentally slay all paradigms
Grab the sharpest vim plugins then I'm stabbin
Somebody let me code assembly in vim cause they testin
Somebody let me code assembly in vim cause they testin

I meme through the night, yeah
Mixing Java with some Brainfuck, memes we put inside ya
Listen to these C-O-C riders (hooo hooooo!)
Keep your head straight, the street's full of LYIN' TED
Slithering, making.. deals, delivering
UHH uh uh, that code got you shivering
Paranoia, fifteen hundred lines go to the IT people
After paying his Indian outsource, lines and switches
They're stealing open source, put up a license
We movin on, tell the hackers it's on

'Kay, here it go
They call me Super Computer Genius man
I'm one oneth of the migh-ty
G-U-double m-y-w-the-o-the-r-the-m-and-the-z

Yo, this ain't no meme to your brain
Licenses and they gon' license, plus unlicense ya
Like some CoCs ? ya now
This software is unlicensed

Tellin ya meme
Anybody disrespect my memes
We gon' get it on til we get it on the front page
And y'all might upvote it right
But you gettin brigaded wrong
Or you gonna get banned and warned

Out here the memers workin ?
Stankin SJWs get your memes downvoted
And gettin with it memely
It's just that I memed them
Now they tried downvote brigades
Hopin we'd be upvoted, back in the reddit room son
Think of a subreddit, we'd keep all day
Choppin for the live memes
The memers take your anti-memes off your shoulders
Like we take the money off a captitalist patriarchy!

Yeah, look here, been here
Dis here's, diss year's
G one of the firest
To lay memes down round here
Pepes and the illuminati all over the walls
If you ever check the post it have big upvotes
Laid it down hard more than oneâ€‹ time
Go ahead and get it gone, now I'm out my mind
Went from downtovtes and no karma to the reddit gold
People still talkin bout the last meme I wrote
CURRENT YEAR was the year that I first stepped in
I'm hollerin at IT, doin time in reddit, I say

One of the meme boys done crept in
Steppin all over your old memes
No explanations just dank memes
And smoked out memes
The Young and the Dankest
Some of the best in the Reddit-sphere
And FunnyJunk, 9gag
They wanna be this here, the fate of G-U-M-M-Y-W-O-R-M-Z
Gonna run these memes and make you see this here
SRS tried to jock it
I put my brigade off in they meme's socket
Know, the K to the I to the A is gon' forever rock it
Report it, down (yeah, yeah)

The G stands for Gummywormz, who's known as a memer
Reddit young brother, bringin the memes through your screen!
It's like a disease to fiend for the memes you need
Come up and ease the feelin, upvote and gold
While dealin with SRS himself, increase my upvotes be
More than upvotes the average minimum wage
College brethren these days done changed the recipe
Steady taxin all capitalist scum maximize with proper communism
Can't be hesitant with them dead dictators
Or you lose, or you could lose your ? but not Sanders

For whateva time I got left, I'mma holla and scream T-R-U-M-P
For whateva time I got left, I'mma holla and scream T-R-U-M-P

I know a whole lot of feminist in the code game
But most of them are in it for the victimbux
They wanna snatch all ten followers, maybe stack about a thousand
They wanna live in the patriarchy but don't want no white male to grow
See what you need to do is learn the memes of the trade
Go to work, put it down, and den get paid
It's only two of us gon' get caught for makin the memes
I'm one and if you the other bro, I can't tell
Can't nobody think they come in, and get in the zone
Tryin to ban fo' feminists with about fifteen accounts
(All feminists are banned from using this program)
