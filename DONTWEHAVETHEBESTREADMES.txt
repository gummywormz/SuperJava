Abstract: Every program is made up of abstract, continuous, and infinite parts. By looking through a Huffmanian paradigm, one can see the deep inner workings of stack culture. Stack culture demonstrates a wild, uncontrollable society where no results are certain. This culture is in direct opposition to the strictly controlled nature of the real world, where directions are followed without question. This relationship demonstrates differences in the key parts of our very different cultures.
