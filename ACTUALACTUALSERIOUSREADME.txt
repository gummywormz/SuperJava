Right... something actually serious.

Many of the dank memes featured in this program may not be exactly "politically correct". These are not meant to target particular groups or ideologies. It's meant to be a parody of the tech / gaming press. 

For example, Misogyny Misogyny is a play on all the "gamers are sexist" article spam. I'm not explicitly stating a side, but recently a science study was spammed linking sexism with video games. Turns out the relation was 0.0005. The study was also flawed in several large ways. 

The whole banning feminists from using this in the "license rap" is a reference to people not reading the terms and conditions. Also, it's a reference to the Geek Feminism Code of Conduct. They went on about all the weird things you couldn't do (they banned assault over the internet. you can't use phrases like "poking @personmemer".) and the usual privacy invasions and twitter drama. Then, they added a specific section stating that incidents regarding "heterophobia" and "reverse racism" would not apply to the code of conduct. Because when creating a progressive safe space, it's right to exclude those evil white males.
